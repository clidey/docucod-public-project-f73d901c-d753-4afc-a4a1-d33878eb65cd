# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you quickly diagnose and resolve frequent problems encountered during NeuralFlow installation and first run. By following practical troubleshooting steps, you'll minimize downtime and ensure a smooth setup experience.

---

## 1. Installation Issues

### Problem: Dependencies Fail to Install

**Symptoms:**
- `npm install` or `yarn install` commands hang, error out, or report missing packages.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. **Verify Node.js and Package Manager Versions**
   - Ensure you have Node.js version 16.x or later installed.
   - Use compatible package managers: npm (>=8), yarn (latest), or pnpm.
   - Check versions:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     yarn -v  # if using yarn
     ```

2. **Clear Cache and Retry**
   - Clear the npm/yarn/pnpm cache:
     ```bash
     npm cache clean --force
     yarn cache clean
     pnpm cache clean
     ```
   - Delete `node_modules` and lock files (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`).
   - Reinstall dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     # OR
     yarn install
     # OR
     pnpm install
     ```

3. **Network and Proxy**
   - Ensure no firewall, VPN, or proxy is blocking package registry URLs.
   - Try switching networks or use a VPN if behind a restrictive firewall.

4. **Permissions**
   - Run the install commands with proper permissions.
   - Avoid `sudo` unless necessary.

<Tip>
If you encounter persistent errors with specific packages, consult the package's GitHub issues or forums for known conflicts with your OS or Node.js version.
</Tip>

### Problem: `git` Not Found or Cloning Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Error during cloning the NeuralFlow repo or submodules

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Confirm Git is installed:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
2. If not installed, download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

3. Ensure your SSH keys (if using SSH clone) or credentials are correctly configured for private repos.

4. Retry cloning:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thedevflex/neuralflow.git
   ```

## 2. Startup and First Run Problems

### Problem: Server Does Not Start or Crashes Immediately

**Symptoms:**
- Running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` throws errors and the server doesn't start.
- Terminal output shows missing environment variables or module errors.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. **Check Environment Variables**
   - NeuralFlow requires key environment variables for authentication and configuration.
   - Ensure `.env.local` exists at the root with correct values:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
     ```
   - Missing or incorrect OAuth credentials will cause startup failure.
   
2. **Install All Dependencies**
   - Run `npm install` or equivalent to ensure no missing dependencies.

3. **Verify Node.js Compatibility**
   - Use Node.js 16+ as older versions may cause runtime failures.

4. **Check Logs for Specific Errors**
   - Review terminal output carefully for missing modules, permissions, or port conflicts.

5. **Port Conflicts**
   - By default, NeuralFlow runs on port 3000.
   - Ensure no other process is using the port:
     ```bash
     lsof -i :3000
     ```
   - If busy, either stop the conflicting service or run NeuralFlow on a different port:
     ```bash
     PORT=3001 npm run dev
     ```

6. **Restart the machine**
   - Some system-level issues clear after a restart.

<Tip>
Add missing environment values first, then run `npm run dev` again. This often resolves the majority of startup errors.
</Tip>

### Problem: Browser Cannot Connect to http://localhost:3000

**Symptoms:**
- Browser times out or shows 'Cannot connect' after starting the server successfully.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Verify the server is running without errors.

2. Check firewall or antivirus programs that might block local ports.

3. Attempt to access using `http://127.0.0.1:3000` instead of `localhost`.

4. Use different browsers or incognito/private mode to rule out caching issues.

5. Confirm the correct port is open and NeuralFlow is listening:
   ```bash
   netstat -an | grep 3000
   ```

## 3. Authentication & OAuth Issues

### Problem: Unable to Log In or OAuth Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Google login fails or redirects endlessly.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Verify Google OAuth credentials in `.env.local` and that they match those set in the Google Cloud Console.

2. Make sure redirect URIs are configured correctly in Google OAuth settings:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

3. Clear browser cookies and cache.

4. Check terminal logs for authentication errors.

## 4. Common Build and Runtime Errors

### Error: Module Not Found or Unexpected Token

- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are fetched.
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall if errors persist.
- Verify you are on Node.js 16+.

### Error: Tailwind CSS Not Applying Styles

- Confirm `tailwind.config.ts` is correctly configured.
- Check imports of the global CSS file `app/globals.css`.
- Restart the development server after config changes.

## 5. Diagnostic and Recovery Tips

- **Use Verbose Logging:** Start the app with verbose logging enabled to get detailed error info.
- **Check Issue Tracker:** Visit the [NeuralFlow GitHub Issues](https://github.com/thedevflex/neuralflow/issues) for reported bugs and fixes.
- **Community Support:** Use community forums or chat channels linked in the NeuralFlow documentation.
- **Update Dependencies Regularly:** Keep your local repo and dependencies up to date with the latest main branch changes.
