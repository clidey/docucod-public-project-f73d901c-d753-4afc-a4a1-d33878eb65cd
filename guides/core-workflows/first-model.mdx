# Build Your First Model (No Code)

Welcome to your hands-on guide for building your first machine learning model using NeuralFlow’s intuitive no-code interface. This page walks you through visually assembling your model step-by-step — from adding layers to connecting them and understanding the entire data flow — all without writing a single line of code.

---

## 1. What You Will Accomplish

This guide will help you:

- Navigate the NeuralFlow visual model builder interface.
- Add and configure model layers using a click-to-connect system.
- Connect layers to shape the neural network's workflow.
- Understand the flow of data from input through to output.
- Complete a functional model ready for training or deployment.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure:

- You have access to the NeuralFlow platform and are logged in.
- Your workspace or project is set up and ready for model building.
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts like layers and model architecture will be helpful but not mandatory.

### Expected Outcome

By completing this guide, you will have visually constructed a simple neural network model using NeuralFlow's drag-and-drop interface, fully connected and ready for next steps like training or exporting.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 15-20 minutes.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner-friendly. Designed for users new to machine learning and no-code environments.

## 2. Getting Started with the Visual Model Builder

NeuralFlow's visual builder is designed for simplicity and clarity. Let's start by familiarizing yourself with its core interface elements.

### Step 1: Open the Model Builder

- Access your workspace and open a new or existing project.
- Navigate to the 'Model Builder' section to launch the visual canvas.

#### What you see:

- A blank workspace (canvas) where layers will appear as nodes.
- A sidebar or menu listing available layers (e.g., Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense).
- Controls for zooming, panning, and undoing/redoing changes.

### Step 2: Add Layers to the Canvas

- Click on the desired layer from the layer palette to add it to the canvas.
- Example: Start by adding an `Input Layer` to serve as the entry point for your data.

#### Expected result:

- The new layer appears as a node on the canvas with a default position.

### Step 3: Configure Layer Parameters

- Click on a layer node to open its configuration panel.
- Adjust parameters such as units, activation functions, kernel size, etc., depending on the layer type.

#### Tips:

- Required fields are clearly marked.
- Default values are provided to get you started quickly.

### Step 4: Connect Layers to Define Data Flow

- Click and drag from the output socket (typically on the right side) of one layer node to the input socket (typically on the left side) of the next.
- This action creates a visible connection (edge) representing the flow of data.
- Continue linking layers to form the desired model architecture.

#### Expected result:

- Connections appear as lines between the nodes.
- The model graph visually represents the order of operations.

### Step 5: Review the Model Workflow

- Ensure your data input starts from the `Input Layer` and flows logically through each connected layer toward the final output layer.
- Use zoom and pan controls to inspect complex connections.

### Step 6: Save Your Model

- After building and connecting layers, click the 'Save' or 'Export' button.
- NeuralFlow saves the model configuration for training and further use.

## 3. Understanding the Model Workflow

By visually connecting layers, you define how data moves from raw input to final output predictions. Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

- **Input Layer:** Captures and formats incoming data.
- **Hidden Layers (e.g., Conv2D, Dense):** Process data through transformations.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce dimensionality while preserving features.
- **Output Layer:** Produces the final result (classification, regression, etc.).

Each connection you make models this flow, so the interface’s clarity helps avoid mistakes in your model's structure.

## 4. Practical Example: Building a Simple Image Classifier

Let’s put theory into practice with a common model example:

1. **Add an `Input Layer`** with shape matching your image data (e.g., 28x28x1 for grayscale images).
2. **Add a `Conv2D Layer`** with 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, activation 'relu'.
3. **Add a `MaxPooling2D Layer`** with pool size 2x2.
4. **Add a `Flatten Layer`** to convert 2D feature maps to 1D vector.
5. **Add a `Dense Layer`** with 128 units and activation 'relu'.
6. **Add an `Output Layer`** with units matching your number of classes, activation 'softmax'.

Connect these layers in the order above. Configure parameters by selecting each node.

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep model architecture clear and logical:** Avoid branching mistakes or disconnected layers.
- **Use default parameters to start:** You can tune them later after initial testing.
- **Name your layers meaningfully:** Helps clarity as your model grows.
- **Utilize undo/redo:** Mistakes are easy to fix without losing progress.
- **Save often:** The visual builder auto-saves, but manual saves ensure no loss.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Cannot connect layers">
- Ensure that the output socket of the source layer and input socket of the target layer are compatible.
- Confirm that the maximum number of allowed connections for the layer is not exceeded.
- Check if the layers support multiple inputs or outputs if connecting in parallel.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Layer configuration options missing or disabled">
- Make sure you have selected the layer node before adjusting parameters.
- Refresh the page or restart the builder if configurations fail to load.
- Contact support if the issue persists.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Model does not save or export">
- Verify your internet connection if using the cloud platform.
- Check for browser compatibility issues.
- Try a different browser or clear cache.
</Accordion>

## 7. Next Steps

After successfully building your first model, consider:

- Proceeding to the [Importing and Using Pretrained TensorFlow Models](/guides/core-workflows/import-model) to combine visual building with pretrained resources.
- Exploring model training within NeuralFlow or exporting the model to your preferred environment.
- Learning about integration options like GitHub synchronization and API accessibility ([Integration Overview](/overview/features-integration/integrations-overview)).
